# Internationalization with AngularJS

This is my first attempt at making a client-side framework for providing string resources for an SPA's entire UI.

This example does in no way indicate how you might want to persist or manage said string resources. You could continue to use static .js files to store the strings, or generate the file on the server-side.

Feel free to contribute to and improve upon this example. For example, im not prefectly happy with using eval on the AngularJS ngLocale file.
